# Hitman 3 (WOA) ChaosMod

This is **ChaosMod**, a mod for Hitman 3!

the chaos mod mod injects random effects into your gameplay to create unpredictable, entertaining and often very difficult to resolve scenarios.
heavily inspired by the [GTA V chaos mod](https://github.com/gta-chaos-mod/ChaosModV).

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the recommended\* version of [ZHMModSDK](https://github.com/OrfeasZ/ZHMModSDK) and install it.
2. Download the recommended\* version of `ChaosMod` and copy it to the ZHMModSDK `mods` folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hitman 3\Retail\mods`).
3. Download the recommended\* version of [Companion Mod](https://github.com/shadow578/ZHMChaosModCompanion) and install it using the [Simple Mod Framework](https://github.com/atampy25/simple-mod-framework) (optional, but recommended).
4. Run the game and once in the main menu, press the `~` key (`^` on QWERTZ layouts) and enable `ChaosMod` from the menu at the top of the screen (you may need to restart your game afterwards).
5. Check the `Enable` option in the ChaosMod menu to start the chaos!
6. Enjoy & good luck!

\* The version to use should generally be the latest release, but check ChaosMod release notes for any specific version requirements.
